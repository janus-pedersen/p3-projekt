% 1. the context or background information for your research; the general topic under study; the specific topic of your research
% 2. the central questions or statement of the problem your research addresses
% 3. what’s already known about this question, what previous research has done or shown
% 4. the main reason(s), the exigency, the rationale, the goals for your research—Why is it important to address these questions? Are you, for example, examining a new topic? Why is that topic worth examining? Are you filling a gap in previous research? Applying new methods to take a fresh look at existing ideas or data? Resolving a dispute within the literature in your field? . . .
% 5. your research and/or analytical methods
% 6. your main findings, results, or arguments
% 7. the significance or implications of your findings or arguments.
